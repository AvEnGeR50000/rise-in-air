During the entire length of this project I have:
1. Created various models used in the game like clouds, raindrop, umbrellas and scissors using blender.
2. Added many changes to downloaded asset models used in the project.
3. Added animation in some of the models using unity.
4. Helped in the formation of powerups present in the game.
5. Supplied inputs in the mainscene.
